Adding:
1. Add in new element as root on last level
2. Compare value with value of parent element 
3. Swap indices if comparison doesn’t follow min/max heap rules
4. Repeat step 2 until heap follows either min/max heap rules

Removing:
1. If node is a root, delete it from the array & replaced with null
2. If node had one child, swap with the child & set to null
3. If node has two children, swap with right child & continue swapping down until it becomes the root
	a) Set old parent to null & delete from array
	b) Check tree to make sure it follows min/max heap rules
